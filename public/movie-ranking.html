"<h1>The Best Movies of all Time According to Justin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Unbelievable script with fantasitc, 
   career defining performances from the whole cast. A multilayered asynchronous
   story with twists and turns throughout. 
   Exquisite direction from Tarantino in his epochal masterpiece.</p>
<h3>The Royal Tenenbaums</h3>
<p>By no means Wes Andersons best work and possibly no longer my favourite 
   but the lasting impact of this movie and how I viewed cinema was
   irrecovably altered as a result of watching this on my 18th birthday.
   Arguably my first introduction to the idea of a director as an auteur, 
   although this understanding would be solidified much later. With its 
   understated humour and wonderful performances I can rewatch this movie
   a million times and not tire. Career best performances for Luke Wilson 
   and Gwyneth Paltrow alongside a stellar cast to long to name, this really 
   is cinema at its finest. Every scene is beautifully constructed and it is all 
   accompanied by possibly one of the greatest movie soundtracks of all time.</p>
<h3>The Big Lebowski</h3>
<p>Much like no.2 on my list this is more about the Coen brothers than it is 
   The Big Lebowski, however like all great love affairs you have to start somewhere
   and me and the Coens started here. With performances so strong by the entire cast
   it is impossible to pick between them. It's hard to ignore Jeff Bridges turn as the
   dude but John Goodman, Steve Buscemi and John Turturro are all irrepressible and cannot
   be ignored. Quite possibly two of the greatest moments in cinema history appear in this movie
   - the dude fitting a door stop on the wrong side of a door and the scattering of the ashes.
